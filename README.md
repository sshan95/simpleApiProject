# ApiApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Functionality

Running this app will showcase the api that was given.  One can see the thumbnail, id and title associated with each dataset on an Angular Materal card.  I have added additional functionality so that when one clicks on a thumbnail, it will go to the associated url.  

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng run test` to execute the unit tests via [Jest].  More specific script commands in package.json
